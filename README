This is a quick implementation of QuineMcCluskey used to minimize terms in a
boolean function. This is by no means an efficient implementation, but it's
working great for my needs. I put this up in case it's useful to others.

Input into the tool is pretty lame right now and I hope to improve that
soonish. Create a file with a single line. That line should roughly be in the
form:

    identifier '(' identifier (',' identifier)* ')' '=' ('0' | '1')*

Example:

    f(a,b,c) = 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1

Note that the total number of zeros and ones should equal two raised to the
number of parameters in the parameter list. Above we have 3 parameters. 2^3 =
8, so we need 8 0's and 1's.

There are more examples in the "examples" folder.

The current implementation is very forgiving, so when you see "identifier" this
really can be any string of text without spaces. This allows you to do things
like the following:

    f(a[0],a[1],a[2]) = ...

This is useful when you are using the output as VHDL/Verilog source.

When you run the tool against a file, it will emit a simple assignment to the
function name with a minimized version of the function after substituting in
the parameter list. For example:

    F(x[0],x[1],x[2]) = 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1 // ∑(2,4,5,6,7)

becomes

    F = x[1] & ~x[2] | x[0]

TODO
====
- Use a real parser or at least something a little more robust.
  - I'd like to allow input using sum-of-minterms as well. For example, the
    above example could be expressed as: f(a,b,c) = ∑(1,2,6,7)
- Improve the currently brute-force calculation of the essential prime
  implicants
- Add an SWT-based GUI front-end, while still allowing the tool to run from the
  command-line
- Add options to emit Verilog and/or VHDL
